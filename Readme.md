# Makeup planner

## Intro note

this project is created for learning purpose. It does not represent best code quality and it's not entirely focused on resolving business problems - rather on learning BE (nest.js) + react-native

## Overview

Application for makeup institute for better events management. It allows managers to create events and get an overview of how many artists and models there are, helping to see how many people they miss for upcoming session (ex. missing 1-2 models).
It can also create a sort of "marketplace" of models or rather a community group where models can see upcoming events and book for a makeup modeling.

## Problem

Sometimes models resign from coming into upcoming session in the last minute. It would be great to have an overview of how many models we do need and to notify already registered users that there are free slots.
